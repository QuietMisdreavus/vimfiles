# icesoldier's vim files

I wanted to stash my vim setup somewhere, so I figured I'd get off
my ass and figure out how git works and centralize my vimrc at the
same time.

I make use of the following plugins. I want to embed them as
submodules once I figure out how, but for now here's just the links.
